### <p align="center"> Or you can simply [contact me](mailto:azimov.workspace@gmail.com) to get demo access to the project due to unavailability of deploying the project, caused by the clerk demanding to have all authorized private domain with all OAuth rights to it, and as I don't own any private domain, it's not feasible to meet this requirement.</p>

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
